This has nothing to do with meek. We just borrow their ID for our
extension, which is symlinked into into Tor Browser's main profile
directory profile.default/ on DisposableVM startup. The actual
meek-http-helper@bamsoftware.com lives in profile.meek-http-helper/,
so there's no conflict.

Why usurp their ID? Firefox has recently added even more signature
requirements specifically for _legacy_ extensions, and they cannot be
disabled by setting the xpinstall.signatures.required pref to false.
But Tor Browser hardcodes an exemption list: Torbutton, TorLauncher,
HTTPS Everywhere, and meek HTTP helper.
